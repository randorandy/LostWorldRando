WEB ROLLER
The most accessible way to use this randomizer is the web roller here:
https://randorandy.github.io/LostWorldRando/

LOCAL DOWNLOAD
If you prefer an offline or custom experience, you may want to use python3 and roll locally:
1.download this repository
2.place a copy of the Redesign rom in the roms folder - it must be named Lost World.sfc
3.run Main.py in console
This should create a randomized rom with the given name in the roms folder and a spoiler log (.txt) in the spoilers folder.

GAMEPLAY
There are many ways to softlock in Lost World,
but also a surprising number of ways to traverse areas with a minimal loadout.
Some key early-game moments are:
1. The first accessible item is at the usual Charge Beam location.
2. The ship crater and the "Parlor" west of it contain many secret items that will probably
   be part of your early progression. Become familiar with them!
3. When you first pass through the underwater crumble blocks in Rock Plains,
   consider that you will need a way to return such as HiJump/Gravity with Morph and Bombs.

FAIR WARNING
This logic has been somewhat tested, but the game is too massive for me to get everything
working perfectly. If you find a logical issue, please contact me and I would love to
improve the logic file.

THANKS
Thanks to beauxq, and without the Subversion rando none of these other projects would have been possible for me:
